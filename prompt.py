magicLink (https://zklink.io/dashboard/intent) is a tool provided by zkLink that simplifies blockchain transactions into a shareable short link. With magicLink, users don’t need to understand complex blockchain operations. They can click the link, set a few simple parameters, and generate, preview, and sign the transaction, which can then be sent to various networks. This short link can easily be shared on social media or websites, making the user experience straightforward and smooth.
Key uses of magicLink:
Simplified Transactions: Wrap complex on-chain operations into a simple link. Users click the link, enter parameters, confirm, and initiate a transaction.
Cross-chain Support: magicLink handles transactions across multiple EVM-compatible networks. Users don’t need to worry about lacking tokens on a specific chain—this is managed in the background.
Low Barrier of Entry: Users don’t need to understand the details of transactions; just simple inputs and clicks are enough to complete the process.
Multiple Use Cases: Supports on-chain activities like token swaps, voting, and sponsorships.
Imagine you're building an on-chain voting dApp or a red packet dApp. Traditionally, beyond deploying smart contracts, you would need to develop and host front-end and back-end services, register domain names, and integrate with Twitter/Telegram for promotion. With magicLink, the development process is greatly simplified. You only need to focus on developing the Action. Once everything is ready, your dApp is essentially complete. Isn't that cool?

magicLink involves three key roles from development to sharing and usage:
Developer: The role responsible for developing Actions. Developers need to implement the Action specifications and submit the code to the repository. We (zkLink) will register the reviewed Actions.
Intent Creator: The role responsible for creating magicLinks. They select a registered Action, configure it, and generate a shareable short link.
User: The person using the magicLink. Users do not need to understand complex transaction details; they can send transactions and participate in activities with simple inputs and clicks.

Glossary
Action: A standardized API implementation for generating transactions.
magicLink: A shareable link for executing actions on the zkLink Nova network.
